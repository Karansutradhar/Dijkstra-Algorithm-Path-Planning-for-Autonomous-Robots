# Path-Planning-for-Autonomous-Robots---Dijkstra-Algorithm
 Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm for a Point and Rigid Robot

READ_ME for Dijkstra_rigid.py and Dijkstra_point.py

dependencies : numpy and opencv

To run each file go to its directory and execute python3 Dijkstra_(rigid/point).py
Enter the x and y coordinates of the start and goal node and the program will begin searching.
The optimal path will be shown in green once (if) it is found.

The rigid robot has a radius of 1 and clearance of 5 while the point robot has a radius of 0 and clearance of 0.
